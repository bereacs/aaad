Testing
=======
To test the site, the first step is to run it locally under Jekyll.

Then, you can test for mobile devices using Screenfly by Quirktools.

Very handy. It lets you know how broken your CSS is for mobile devices by showing you what your site looks like when you compress the screen size.
