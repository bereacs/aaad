### Installs

We need to install a bunch of software.

Specifically, I'd like to suggest we install software for both Java and PhoneGap development. Fortunately, we need 100% of the former to support any of the latter, so this does not represent "double effort."

#### Android Development in Java

You can follow [the instructions provided by Google](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), or you can follow the [PhoneGap instructions](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/guide_getting-started_android_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20Android).

#### PhoneGap Development in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

After you get the Android environment setup and tested, you can skip over to the PhoneGap site and [set up their tools as well](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/guide_getting-started_android_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20Android).

#### AppInventor

Lastly, because you'll be sprinting through the AppInventor course, you will need to [setup the AppInventor environment](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) on your machine. Again, good luck. This one is annoying to set up under Windows, apparently.
