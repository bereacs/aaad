### Syllabus Planning

We need a syllabus. It is, for our purposes, a contract. You are **strongly encouraged** to start with any syallbus in the CS department and use it as a starting point. Dr. Jan has several, and the recent [Craft of Electronics](http://craftofelectronics.org/) syllabus copies the structure of many of them. By **strongly encouraged**, I mean "please use something else as a starting point." There's no sense in reinventing things where it isn't necessary.

There are a few things you should pay special attention to.


#### Milestones

We'll provide you with some milestones that are going to be necessary in our collaborations with the Brand and Communications group. I'll probably just update this page, right here...


#### Assessment

How should we assess your work? Will you be making regular weekly or bi-weekly reports? Will there be a final presentation, video, or poster session? Should we just measure how much money you made on the Google Play store? I'm thinking $5000 is a C, $50,000 is a B, and $500,000 is an A. (I am *kidding*; that sounds like an awful metric, unless we were creating a soul-crushing reality TV show.) 

Also, you should consider how we will evaluate team process. As we expect you will be collaborating, what elements of the syllabus can you use to encourage and support each-other in contributing and being excellent members of the team study? (We might be able to provide you with some ideas here.)

Regardless, think about how you want your efforts to be evaluated; if you hold yourself to a high standard, we'll do everything we can to help you achieve it, and we think the experience will be better for it.

#### Licensing

You should probably draw up a short "licensing" contract. Everything you do for your "clients" needs to be licensed openly; [there are many open source licenses to choose from](http://opensource.org/licenses/category). I recommend you consider the [Apache](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), [GPL](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), and [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licenses. You have to slow down your reading, and think about what they say... but, this is part of being a computer scientist. We make things; allowed use and how things should be shared should be considered.

(If you really throw up your hands, we'll help you pick a license.)

You also need to decide how you will handle licensing on anything else you work on collaboratively. It is almost impossible to "share" an idea. So, if Bonnie and Clyde work together on a project, it might be best to either 1) agree to release the software under an open license (so Bonnie, Clyde, and the rest of the world can continue to work on it), or 2) you have a very complex situation on your hand in terms of ownership. We can talk more about this online. This is why we think that everything you do, for a grade, in this class, should be licensed openly. It actually makes things simpler. 

That is our opinion; we want you to discuss these things.
