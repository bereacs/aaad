### Create a BitBucket Account
We will be using BitBucket as our host for version control this term. Our preferred version control system will be Git.

#### Create the Account

Go to [bitbucket.org](bitbucket.org). Create an account.

You can create an account using any username you wish. For example, your account could be called **crazzyl33tcoder**, to show off that you are unable to spell, but think you're an amazing programmer. Personally, I recommend using something that you think will show well in a professional context. For example, years ago I settled on **jadudm** as my typical online account name/handle, because it was my username at my undergraduate institution.

You **must use your berea.edu address** when you create this account. The reason for that is...

#### Apply for Educational Account Status

After you create your account, visit this webpage:

[http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp](http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp)

Fill out the form, and request an educational account. You can probably leave the "additional notes" field blank.

##### NOTE

It is possible that you will *automatically* be granted an educational license if you use your berea.edu email address. I just added my email address to the account, and without filling out this form, my account was magically granted "Academic" status. This may be true for you as well. 

It is important that you have *Academic* status, otherwise you will not be able to collaborate with your classmates on private repositories. You'll learn more about this as part of the course; for now, it is only for you to do, not to understand. Understanding comes later.
