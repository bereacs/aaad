###  Reading

You should probably do some reading/browsing. How much? I don't know. I recommend setting some reading goals as a group, and sharing things you find online as you go.

For example, the [Android Developer site](http://developer.android.com/index.html) might be a good set of pages to get cozy with. Learn what is there and think about what might be useful, as you might be going there a lot for documentation. (Or, possibly not.)
