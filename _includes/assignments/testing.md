### Testing

Finally, we need to know if our development environments work.

#### Android w/ Java

I suspect you can follow the [workflow laid out on Google's site](http://developer.android.com/tools/workflow/index.html) to get a "Hello World" app tested. Share resources on the mailing list if you find a good tutorial or set of resources that will help your classmates.

#### PhoneGap

The [PhoneGap website](http://phonegap.com/), as well as pages around the 'net, have resources you can use to create a trivial "Hello World" application. 

#### Why "Hello World?"

We're making sure that our software development tools work. It will take you time. It is tedious. I hate this part. It's confusing, and there's a lot of detail that you have to keep track of. Follow instructions closely, don't skip steps, and use Google. For that matter, *use our mailing list*. We have a little developer community of our own; if you get stuck, use Google, ask for help, or (if all else fails), try uninstalling and starting over.
